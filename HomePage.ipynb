    "I am a PhD candidate at the Bennett Department of Chemistry at West Virginia University (2014-present). I use computational biophysics to understand what we believe would become a next generation cancer diagnostic and therapeutic agent. Click [here](http://chitrakgupta.github.io/Research/) for a more detailed description of my work and [here](http://www.mertzlab-biophysics.com) to view our research group led by Dr. Blake Mertz.\n",

    "My PhD research involves sifting through large amounts (gigabytes) of data generated by molecular dynamics simulation to derive key insights. I also spend time to build and benchmark software on high performance computer (HPC) clusters, both at WVU and XSEDE. I am interested in exploiting my computational skills to analyze complex data sets in biomedicine and beyond.\n",
