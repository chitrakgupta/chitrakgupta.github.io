    "### What are some of the things I need to know?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, you need to work from the command line. This can be a new experience ('new' is not synonymous to 'difficult'). Here are some of the things to keep in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Command line is case-sensitive. If the name of your file is \"My_File.txt\" and you search for \"my_File.txt\", the file shall not be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Command line is also sensitive to file location. On Windows search menu, you can search for \"my file\" and it will look for all files that sounds similar and find it for you. On the command line, in need to be in the correct folder (which we call \"path\") in order to find the file. Otherwise, even if you are searching for exactly \"My_File.txt\", it will be not be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Command line is sensitive to spaces. In fact, space has special meanings on the command line. Thus, <font color='red'>**you are strongly recommended to avoid spaces when naming files**</font>. If you wanted to name your file \"My File\", maybe make it \"My_File\". Replace the space with underscore, or hyphen, or something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Command line has auto-completion. Until now, you might have been thinking \"why on earth does anyone ever use command line\"? There are many reasons, but one cool feature is the auto complete. If you are in the correct path and looking for My_File.txt, and there are no other files in that path whose name starts My, then you can just type My and hit tab. It will complete the rest of the file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "If nothing shows up, there are two possibilities:\n",
    "              1. The file isn't there\n",
    "              2. There are more than one files starting with My.\n",
    "              \n",
    "To know which, hit tab twice. If nothing shows up, it is option 1. If it is option 2., all files starting with My will be listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a great feature and <font color='red'>**you are strongly encouraged to use it**</font>. It helps you save time typing those extra characters, helps you avoid typos, and tells you instantly if the file is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. In the first few weeks, most of your errors are going to involve one or more of the points mentioned above. If namd2 crashed immediately, chances are the configuration file doesn't exist in the path where you launched namd2 from. Or, maybe you typed Namd2 instead of namd2. Or you forgot a space between namd2 and the configuration file name. Or something like that."

    "### What's all this....NAMD, CHARMM, AMBER.....?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are getting started with MD simulation, this might be confusing. Partly because the terms \"CHARMM\" and \"AMBER\" are used interchangeably to mean the MD engine and a force field parameter set. Let me explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a MD simulation, you need a software that runs this simulation for you.....that's our MD engine. And, when running this simulation, the engine needs, among other things, a description of the forces acting on your system. This description is coded in the \"force field\" files.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHARMM is a MD simulation engine, and also has its own force field parameters. If someone says \"I ran the simulation in CHARMM\", it usually means they used the CHARMM engine. If they say \"I parameterized my system using CHARMM\", they are refering to the CHARMM force field parameters. \"CHARMM22\", \"CHARMM27\", \"CHARMM36\" are all different versions of the CHARMM parameter set. This is different from the simulation engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amber is a MD simulation engine, it also has its own force field parameters. Terms like \"Amber14\", \"Amber16\" and \"Amber18\" refers to the MD engine. In literature, however, you might not see the term \"Amber parameters\". Instead, you might encounter terms like \"GAFF\" (stands for General Amber Force Field) or \"ff14SB\" (this is Amber's protein force field) etc. It's confusing, I know!\n",
    "\n",
    "NAMD is a MD simulation engine. It does not have its own parameter set. All NAMD tutorials use CHARMM parameters. But you can of course use AMBER parameters to run simulations using NAMD."

    "### So does that mean I can mix-and-match force fields and simulation engines?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, provided you know what you are doing (in other words, speak to your supervisor and/or TA if you plan on doing this). But in general, you can use CHARMM parameters to run simulation in AMBER simulation engine, or AMBER parameters to run simulations in NAMD. I personally have never ran simulations in CHARMM simulation engine, so cannot comment on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this is not always trivial is because every force field was designed to be used in a certain way, and the \"default\" simulation engine has those ways built into it. If you are doing a mix-and-match, make sure the force field is being used in the correct way."

    "### Wait, you never said anything about VMD\n",
    "\n",
    "Ah, yes! VMD is a visualization and analysis tool. It is developed by the same group as NAMD, **but these two are totally different from each other**. VMD can help you prepare your simulation files before you run a simulation. It also lets you visualize your trajectory after you run the simulation. And it is great for analyzing your trajectory. There are some built-in analysis tools (like RMSD), and it also lets you develop your own analysis tools through a tcl interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "VMD is by no means the only such tool. AMBER developers have their own analysis tool, called cpptraj. And doing a mix-and-match is much easier here, in that there are no such 'built-in' things that I referred to in the previous question. You can easily run a simulation in AMBER and analyze it in VMD."
