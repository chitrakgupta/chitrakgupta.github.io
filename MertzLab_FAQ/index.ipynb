    "#### What are some of the things I need to know?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, you need to work from the command line. This can be a new experience ('new' is not synonymous to 'difficult'). Here are some of the things to keep in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Command line is case-sensitive. If the name of your file is \"My_File.txt\" and you search for \"my_File.txt\", the file shall not be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Command line is also sensitive to file location. On Windows search menu, you can search for \"my file\" and it will look for all files that sounds similar and find it for you. On the command line, in need to be in the correct folder (which we call \"path\") in order to find the file. Otherwise, even if you are searching for exactly \"My_File.txt\", it will be not be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Command line is sensitive to spaces. In fact, space has special meanings on the command line. Thus, **you are strongly recommended to avoid spaces when naming files**. If you wanted to name your file \"My File\", maybe make it \"My_File\". Replace the space with underscore, or hyphen, or something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Command line has auto-completion. Until now, you might have been thinking \"why on earth does anyone ever use command line\"? There are many reasons, but one cool feature is the auto complete. If you are in the correct path and looking for My_File.txt, and there are no other files in that path whose name starts My, then you can just type My and hit tab. It will complete the rest of the file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "If nothing shows up, there are two possibilities:\n",
    "              1. The file isn't there\n",
    "              2. There are more than one files starting with My.\n",
    "              \n",
    "To know which, hit tab twice. If nothing shows up, it is option 1. If it is option 2., all files starting with My will be listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a great feature and **you are strongly encouraged to use it**. It helps you save time typing those extra characters, helps you avoid typos, and tells you instantly if the file is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. In the first few weeks, most of your errors are going to involve one or more of the points mentioned above. If namd2 crashed immediately, chances are the configuration file doesn't exist in the path where you launched namd2 from. Or, maybe you typed Namd2 instead of namd2. Or you forgot a space between namd2 and the configuration file name. Or something like that."
