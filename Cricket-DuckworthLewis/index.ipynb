    "## Introduction\n",
    "Duckworth-Lewis method (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duckworth%E2%80%93Lewis_method) is used to calculate the modified target score for the team batting second in a cricket match where some overs are lost due to rain interruption. In this blog, I have taken a close look at such matches, primarily focusing on location (country) and the time of the year when a match is most likely to get affected by D/L.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is available on espncricinfo.com. Scraping the website and converting the data into csv format was done by Gaurav Sood (https://github.com/soodoku/get-cricket-data) and Derek Willis (https://github.com/dwillis/toss-up). I used the two csv files published by these authors on their respective github repositories, where they did an excellent review of the effect of toss in a cricket match (including the effect of toss on D/L affected matches)."
