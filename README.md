# About me

I am a PhD candidate at the Bennett Department of Chemistry at West Virginia University (2014-present). I use computational biophysics to understand what we believe would become a next generation cancer diagnostic and therapeutic agent. [Here](http://www.mertzlab-biophysics.com) is a link to our research group led by Dr. Blake Mertz.

My PhD research involves sifting through large amounts (gigabytes) of data generated by molecular dynamics simulation to derive key insights. I am interested in a career in data science where I can exploit my experience of analyzing complex data. 

In this blog, I have uploaded some of the analysis that I have performed on publicly available data sets.
